This assignment won't be submitted until we've covered Rmarkdown.
Create R chunks for each question and insert your R code appropriately.

1. **Working with data** In the `datasets` folder on the course GitHub repo, you will find a file called `cancer.csv`, which is a dataset in comma-separated values (csv) format. This is a large cancer incidence dataset that summarizes the incidence of different cancers for various subgroups. (18 points)

    1. Load the data set into R and make it a data frame called `cancer.df`. (2 points)

    ```{r}
    f <- file.path('~', 'projects', 'computing_class', 'Bios6301', 'datasets', 'cancer.csv')
    cancer.df <- read.csv(f)
    ```

    2. Determine the number of rows and columns in the data frame. (2)

    ```{r}
    dim(cancer.df)
    ```

    3. Extract the names of the columns in `cancer.df`. (2)

    ```{r}
    names(cancer.df)
    ```

    4. Report the value of the 3000th row in column 6. (2)

    ```{r}
    cancer.df[3000,6]
    ```

    5. Report the contents of the 172nd row. (2)

    ```{r}
    cancer.df[172,]
    ```

    6. Create a new column that is the incidence *rate* (per 100,000) for each row.(3)

    ```{r}
    cancer.df[,'rate'] <- cancer.df[,'incidence']/cancer.df[,'population']*100000
    ```

    7. How many subgroups (rows) have a zero incidence rate? (2)

    ```{r}
    sum(cancer.df[,'rate'] == 0)
    ```

    8. Find the subgroup with the highest incidence rate.(3)

    ```{r}
    which.max(cancer.df[,'rate'])
    cancer.df[which.max(cancer.df[,'rate']),]
    # better, in case multiple matches
    cancer.df[cancer.df[,'rate'] == max(cancer.df[,'rate']),]
    ```

2. **Data types** (10 points)

    1. Create the following vector: `x <- c("5","12","7")`. Which of the following commands will produce an error message? For each command, Either explain why they should be errors, or explain the non-erroneous result. (4 points)

            max(x)
            sort(x)
            sum(x)

    2. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            y <- c("5",7,12)
            y[2] + y[3]

    3. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            z <- data.frame(z1="5",z2=7,z3=12)
            z[1,2] + z[1,3]

3. **Data structures** Give R expressions that return the following matrices and vectors (*i.e.* do not construct them manually). (3 points each, 12 total)

    1. $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)$

    ```{r}
    c(seq(1,8), seq(7,1))
    ```
    
    2. $(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)$

    ```{r}
    rep(1:5, times=1:5)
    ```

    3. $\begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1 & 1  \\
      1 & 0 & 1  \\
      1 & 1 & 0  \\
    \end{pmatrix}$

    ```{r}
    +!diag(3)
    ```

    4. $\begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
      1 & 4 & 9 & 16 \\
      1 & 8 & 27 & 64  \\
      1 & 16 & 81 & 256 \\
      1 & 32 & 243 & 1024  \\
    \end{pmatrix}$

    ```{r}
    t(outer(1:4, 1:5, "^"))
    ```

4. **Basic programming** (10 points)

    1. Let $h(x,n)=1+x+x^2+\ldots+x^n = \sum_{i=0}^n x^i$. Write an R program to calculate $h(x,n)$ using a `for` loop. (5 points)

    ```{r}
    x <- 5
    n <- 2
    h <- 0
    for(i in seq(0,n)) {
      h <- h + x^i
    }
    h
    ```

    2. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write an R program to perform the following calculations. (5 points)

        1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000. (3, [euler1])

            ```{r}
            sum(unique(c(seq(3,999,by=3), seq(5,999,by=5))))
            ```

        2. Find the sum of all the multiples of 4 or 7 below 1,000,000. (2)

            ```{r}
            options(scipen=10)
            sum(unique(c(seq(4,999999,by=4), seq(7,999999,by=7))))
            ```

    3. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be $(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89)$. Write an R program to calculate the sum of the first 15 even-valued terms. (5 bonus points, [euler2])

        ```{r}
        r <- numeric(15)
        r[1] <- 2
        i <- 2
        x1 <- 1
        x2 <- 2
        while(i <= 15) {
          n <- x1 + x2
          x1 <- x2
          x2 <- n
          if(n %% 2 == 0) {
            r[i] <- n
            i <- i+1
          }
        }
        r
        sum(r)
        ```
